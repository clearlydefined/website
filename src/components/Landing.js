              Knowing simple things like the source location for a component version enables contribution of docs, bug
              fixes, or new features. It also inspires confidence by enabling IP and security code scans, and source code
              archiving and disclosure. Round that out with project and issue tracking site info, and you have a sound
              basis for engagement.

            <h3>
              Defining and knowing the license for a component is essential to a successful partnership. Communities choose
              a license with terms they like. {clearlyDefined} helps clarify that choice and enables consumers to
              do follow the terms by identifying key data such as license set, attribution parties, and code location.

            <h2><Clearly>Secure</Clearly></h2>
            <h3>
              Teams working hard to create quality, secure components need a simple way of recording security issues they find
              and fix. Bug report and pull requests are great. CVEs and global notifications are even better. It can still
              be hard to relate that data to the components you use. {clearlyDefined} gives communities a security forum that
              builds confidence and makes for even more collaboration. Learn more...
